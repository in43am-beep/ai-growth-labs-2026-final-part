### Notes:
- Blog posts created in `pages/blog/` subfolder with proper nav using `../../` relative paths
- Blog post pages include BlogPosting schema markup (separate from LocalBusiness schema on service pages)
- Contact form uses client-side success handler (no backend endpoint) — consider adding backend integration in future
- Free audit form already had backend integration via runAudit() function
- All inner page nav links use `../pages/` prefix for correct relative paths from pages directory
- Dashboard main.py already has commented-out code for AI APIs, Stripe, Twilio — packages now in requirements.txt, just need API keys configured and code uncommented
- Expert analysis recommends 8 new services to add as website pages (AI Visibility, Website Design, Email Marketing, Reputation Repair, Listing Management, etc.)
